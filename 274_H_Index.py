274. H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Thoughts:
    Sorting is needed to reduce the time complexity. The best way is to use a counting sort, because we already know
    the upper limit of the groups, so this sorting's time complexity is reduced to O(n + n) = O(n), which is faster
    than a normal sorting algorithm with complexity of O(nlogn).

    for c in citations:
        if c > len(citations):
